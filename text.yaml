As you look around, you see that the doors to Heinz Chapel are open slightly, a sign maybe? You head inside, and you notice some creepy statues, one looks almost... lifelike. It turns to you, okay are you sure you weren't drinking tonight? The statue speaks to you \"I am one of the ancient guardians of the Cathedral, I sense that you are looking for a key. If you are truly the hidden defender, you will be able to answer my riddle\" You nod apprehensively, guess you have nothing to lose right? \"The statue speaks again: You will always find me in the past. I can be created in the prsent, but the future can never taint me. What am I?\" Your ever helpful narrator gives you a hint. Answer in one word"
